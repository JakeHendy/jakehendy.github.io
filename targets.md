* [ ] Work more on [`LoadTester32`](https://github.com/JakeHendy/LoadTester32)
  I wanted to learn some C++ and Win32 at the same time, and Load Testing is a love of mine. 
* [ ] Do some basic graphics programming (shadertoy!)
* [ ] Create a program to understand traffic patterns and predict with some machine learning
