For everything in life and more, there's ~Mastercard~ referrals. Quite literally, everything has a referral scheme right now. From my credit cards, to my flower delivery, to coffee beans, and more.

What's even better, is they're quite often open to anyone. You don't need to know me for realsies (oh, lucky you again) to take advantage.

In all cases, I don't know your personal details. I might see obfuscate parts, like your first two letters of your email address such as `ab....@hotmail.com`, but that's all.

## Gifts

### Flowers: Bloom & Wild

Bloom & Wild have great customer service and a nice selection of flowers; either build your own or have them pre-arranged. If you ever get a duff set of stems (even if one is broken or soft) let them know and they'll sort you out.

You get £10 credit, I get £10 credit. [Referral Link for Bloom and Wild][jakebaw]. Or you can just use my name `Jake Hendy`! They might ask for an email, if so it's `me@` this website!

## Finance

### American Express

I went big on AmEx cards. There are many perks, although they don't neatly overlap. I started with Gold, then got Platinum, and then the British Airways Premium.
In every case, have a read through of which works for you [Head for Points][hfp], who provide wonderful reviews. Occasionally, they have better offers than I do, so do check!

Another big benefit is the offers you can load to your cards, with offers tailored to your spending. There are some big savings to be had, if you get lucky.

#### American Express Gold

Head for Points suggests the AmEx Gold [is the best beginner card if you want to collect points][hfpgold].
Key highlights are on travel spend, but also £5 from Deliveroo twice a month when you pay with your AmEx. If you Deliveroo often enough, you could make up the cost of the card instantly

I get 14,000 AmEx points for you signing up. You can get 30,000 AmEx points if you spend £3,000 within the first 3 months. [Referral Link for Gold][jakegold]

#### American Express Platinum

There's a high fee for this one, but the Hotel Perks, Travel Insurance, and food make it worth it for me.

I get 18,000 AmEx points for you signing up. You can get 70,000 (!) AmEx points if you spend £6,000 within the first 3 months. [Referral Link for Platinum][jakeplatinum]

#### British Airways Premium

This is amazing just for the Companion Voucher alone, although it's now harder to get. Spend £15,000 in a year and you can get a companion voucher, either a return seat free or if you're flying solo, your return leg is free.

I get 12,000 avios for you signing up. You can get 33,000 avios if you spend £6,000 in your first 3 months of membership. [Referral Link for BA Premium][jakebapp]
