##Â Because sometimes you just need to SSH in and investigate with a terminal

Following on from _[Bastions on AWS]({% post_url 2020-01-29-Bastions-on-AWS %})_ this post (or series) will look at using some additional AWS tools to grant us the ability to launch bastion boxes for single-use operations with full auditing and shutdown capabilities.

We will use:

* API Gateway so we can hit a URL and kickstart the launch
* Lambda with
  * CloudTrail, so that when an EC2 is shutdown for more than 5 minutes it's terminated
  * API Gateway to provision our bastion
* Cognito for SSO with API Gateway

## Yes lambda is necessary

You can do *many* things with API Gateway, including launching an instance with a simple REST call. Honestly I did it:
```
GET /vac-list/launch

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<RunInstancesResponse xmlns="http://ec2.amazonaws.com/doc/2016-11-15/">
    <requestId>b0f2952d-4c1a-412e-a831-623662c82ec8</requestId>
    <reservationId>r-0bbafa6990468fabe</reservationId>
    ...
</RunInstancesResponse>
```
The API Gateway execution log includes
```
Endpoint request URI: https://ec2.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/?Action=RunInstances&KeyName=aws-ec2_2&Version=2016-11-15&ImageId=ami-0089b31e09ac3fffc&MaxCount=1&InstanceType=t3a.nano&MinCount=1
```

However, the response is in XML and thus you can't use API Gateway's very powerful response mapping functionality with it.
It seems this is a limitation with the EC2 API, other APIs accept the `Content-Type: application/json` header and respond accordingly but not the one API we want!
At some point I'll post about one our core APIs which uses API Gateway directly with DynamoDB... after this series ðŸ˜€.

To make up for this shortfall in the EC2 API we're going to use lambda to do the heavy lifting for us.
We're going to start with a simple API Gateway which returns a JSON array of objects detailing the VPCs in a given region, defaulting to `eu-west-2`:

```
GET /information/vpcs
```

```json
{
    "region": "eu-west-2",
    "vpcs": [
        {
            "id": "vpc-xxxxxxx",
            "name": "TheBestVPC"
        }
    ]
}
```

The [EC2 DescribeVpcs][EC2DescVPC] gives us all of this with pagination if required, so this lambda should be nice and simple.
