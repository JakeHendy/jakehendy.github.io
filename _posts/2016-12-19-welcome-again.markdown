I've restarted my blog, again. I've wiped away the old posts, as I don't feel comfortable with their quality nor their content.
I've kept the simple Jekyll default theme for the moment as I focus on the content and a more long-term site design. 

As you may see from the navigation, there's a page called [_Targets_](/targets) which has a few targets for me to achieve.
I'll blog about these targets, how I'm achieving them, issues etcetera. What a blog _should_ be :wink:
