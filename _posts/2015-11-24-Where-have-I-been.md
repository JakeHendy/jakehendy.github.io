title: Where have I been...
---

Wow, I set this blog up over a year ago. Back then I didn't know how to drive, I'd not started my Gym Instructor training nor did I think I'd be here with my beautiful girlfriend. It's great how times change.

I kept meaning to write something on here, but never found the time to. Either I was too tired, or too distracted by something else. Well, that's changing now. I've quite a few things I'd like to write about, so I'm going to start working on them now. 

A few things I'd like to write something about:

- Caching
    Something else I'd like to do is write my own Cache library in both C# and Java. I'd like to get back in to C# and it'll be an interesting challenge.
- Angular 2.
    Angular looks to be heading in an interesting direction. I haven't done much Angular before now, so this would be a good learning curve
- WinJS
    I like the look of this library a lot. I've always taken a fancy to the Microsoft [Modern Design](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/stories/design/) principles...  _\[I always get Markdown links wrong :disappointed:\]_
  
I'd also like to start hacking on Chromium, but I'll have to get my C++ skills up to scratch first. I just need to decide a good topic for a side project!
