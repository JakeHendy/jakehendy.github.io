Title: We're finally here...
---

# We are here people! 

After a month I've finally got my blog public. After some DNS woes &mdash; no I totally did not knock out my emails for 3 days before realising &mdash; and sadly having to move some content away from MediaTemple, plus some Google Webmaster Tool work, it's live. I should start appearing towards the top of search results now too, as my site is accessible at `jakehendy.com` and `www.jakehendy.com`. That'll be nice.

I have to say though, actually creating the blog was the easiest part of all of this. I still love the [Lanyard](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme and the ability to add posts from anywhere I have a (decent!) internet connection will hopefully mean I blog more. Who knows. Maybe. I like being able to just pop open my laptop or my phone on my lunch break and just work on it. It's somewhat relaxing!

Now I just have to remember syntax for Jekyll...
