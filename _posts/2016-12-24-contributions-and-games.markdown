It's been a nice week, as it's been the first week of my annual leave. It's been busy, fast-paced week, but I _finally_ contributed back to Chromium this week. It felt, really, really good.

## Chromium?!

Yeah, hopefully! The [bug (671930)][1] in question is a 1px icon mis-alignment in the Dev Tools Source panel. 

A 1px mis-alignment in the DevTools source panel. Nothing fancy,  but it got me started with the codebase which is half the battle. It took me some time to get up to scratch and to devote some time to actually coding, but I'm *really* glad I got it submitted. It was a great little buzz, and I'm looking forward to picking up more interesting tasks/bugs in the future. If I'm allowed, of course :)

1 hour, 45 minute build times aren't the best however; even with an i7-4770K, 16GB of RAM, and an SSD. To be fair, the CPU was the bottleneck, all 8 threads were maxxed out at 100%

. If I keep at this, I'll separate out my dev and gaming boxes so at least I can do something while it builds :) 

## The title mentioned games?

Yeah man I'm making my own gam—nah I'm kidding not yet! [Advent of Code][2] is something I found last year but never did, but I'm actually going to do it this year. I'm only what, 24 days late? Most definitely 25 days (UK time) by the time you're reading this. 

I've added a little extra challenge on for myself though, I'm going to do it in C#—my original love! Then, I'm going to do it in VC++ so I can really learn some good C++ with an actual project. Then, once I've done that, I'm going to try F# as well. 

I'll be publishing all the results at [github.com/jakehendy/advent-of-code-2016][3] so others can see what I did, I can easily ask for feedback, and later down the line see where I went wrong. If I commit often, I may even be able to follow my own trail of thought. Wouldn't that be wonderful? :smile:
