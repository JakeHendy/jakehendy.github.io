Hi! I'm Jake Hendy, a Technical Lead working at the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk).

At the Met Office I lead a team building the data platform which delivers to the Met Office website and mobile app. Watch this space 😋
I'm a huge proponent of monorepos, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code. Not in code, not on production™.
We build on AWS, using CloudFormation, with services written in Java with Python doing work here and there.

In my spare time, I'm a qualified [BodyCOMBAT](https://www.lesmills.com/uk/workouts/group-fitness/bodycombat/) instructor and enjoy going to the gym. My girlfriend and I have 2 pet rabbits, my mum and I have 3 cats and a myriad of tropical fish. If I'm not programming, either at work or at home,at the gym, or spending time with my family; I'm probably squeezing in some ~game time on something like _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)_, or _Counter Strike: Global Offensive_~, or something else! Alas my trusty 780 Ti has moved on so it's time to take a break from games. Occasionally my girlfriend and I play _Ultimate Chicken Horse_ or _Forza_ on my Xbox.
