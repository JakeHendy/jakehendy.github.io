Hi! I'm Jake Hendy, a software developer living in Exeter, England. 

In my current role I mostly write Java, making use of Spring and Guava libraries and the holy relief that is Java 8's streams. I started out my programming life by writing in C#, a language that will always hold a special place in my heart and if given the choice, would use over Java—especially with .NET Core. 

I'm also heavily interested in system administration and networking. I've experience with AWS, for one-off simple systems and entire architectures. I feel comfortable using Windows, Linux (RHEL-like systems), and OS X. 

In my spare time, I'm a qualified [BodyCOMBAT](https://www.lesmills.com/uk/workouts/group-fitness/bodycombat/) instructor and enjoy going to the gym. My girlfriend and I have 2 pet rabbits, my mum and I have 2 cats and a myriad of tropical fish. If I'm not programming—at work or at home—at the gym or spending time with my family, I'm probably squeezing in some game time on something like _Battlefield 4_, _Cities: Skylines_, _Grand Theft Auto: V_, or something else!
