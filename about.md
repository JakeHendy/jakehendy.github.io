Hello! Do you have a few questions? Okay, I'll try answer some!

# Who are you?
Me, I'm Jake Hendy. I'm 20 and live in Exeter, United Kingdom. I can code in a myriad of languages,
but by day I use Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I started off with C# and I'm learning Objective-C.

When I'm not working for the [Met Office](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk), I may be at the gym. I'm a fully qualified [Les Mills](http://www.lesmills.com) BodyCOMBAT instructor. I also play plenty of games, enjoy a good drive and spending time with with my girlfriend.

# This site looks familiar
Yeah it's an awesome theme called [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) from [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo).
Perhaps in the future I'll write my own, but for now I really like this one.

# What games do you play?!
You, you asked. Alright. I mainly play Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I'm (currently) ranked at Supreme Master First Class. I've played Battlefield 4 before, hop in to Minecraft every now and again along with Cities: Skylines.

# Cool, where else do you hang out online?
My twitter is [@JakeHendy](https://twitter.com/JakeHendy), my GitHub
account is [JakeHendy](https://www.github.com/JakeHendy). I'll be setting up a LinkedIn at some point, if you know me personally.
