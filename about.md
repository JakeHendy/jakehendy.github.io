Hi! I'm Jake Hendy, a Technical Lead working at the [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk).

At the Met Office I lead a team building the data platform which delivers to the Met Office website and mobile app. Watch this space ðŸ˜‹
I'm a huge proponent of monorepos, continuous delivery, and infrastructure as code. Not in code, not on productionâ„¢. 
We build on AWS, using CloudFormation, with services written in Java with Python doing work here and there.

In my spare time, I'm a qualified [BodyCOMBAT](https://www.lesmills.com/uk/workouts/group-fitness/bodycombat/) instructor and enjoy going to the gym. My girlfriend and I have 2 pet rabbits, my mum and I have 2 cats and a myriad of tropical fish. If I'm not programmingâ€”at work or at homeâ€”at the gym or spending time with my family, I'm probably squeezing in some game time on something like _Battlefield 1_, _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_, _Battlefield 4_, _Cities: Skylines_, _Grand Theft Auto: V_, or something else! Occasionally my girlfriend and I play _Ultimate Chicken Horse_ or _Forza_ on my Xbox.
