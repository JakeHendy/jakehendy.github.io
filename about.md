Hello! üëãüèº

Surprise, it's me, Jake Hendy. I'm a Cloud Engineering Lead working for [IAG][iag], specifically in [IAG Global Business Services][iaggbs].

I'm an experienced AWS engineer, covering everything from EC2 infrastructure to Containers to Serverless, as well as configuration and operations of a cloud platform or service. In other words, everything but Machine Learning üôÇ

Working in the Cloud Centre of Excellence at IAG I lead the team implementing and developing our AWS Cloud Platform, enabling our internal customers to build on an effective and secure platform.

Previous to joining IAG, I worked for the [Met Office][metoffice] as a Technical Lead, most recently in the Surface Observations group providing near-real-time processing of land- and sea-surface observations. Prior to Surface Observations I worked in the Digital Delivery group providing data and services to our digital channels such as the website, mobile app, and our public API offering.
Of note, I led the work to migrate our Push Notifications System from one-provider-and-EC2 to a serverless platform using AWS PinPoint without incident, and moving Surface Observations to running on ARM instead of x86, the former giving me a [service page testimonial][pinpoint-testimonial] and the latter a blog post on AWS: _[How to Arm a world-leading forecast model with AWS Graviton and Lambda][aws-blog]_.

Outside of work I teach [BodyCOMBAT][bodycombat] group fitness classes and enjoy cooking, gaming, Formula 1, being outdoors, being indoors, DIY, etc.
