Hey there! You're checking out my about page. That's good right? Right... yeah. Right!

# Who are you?
Me, I'm Jake Hendy. I'm 18 and live in Exeter, United Kingdom. I can code in a myriad of languages,
but by day I use Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I started off with C# and I'm learning Objective-C.

I can also make some pixels dance to my tune if the situation calls for it. I'd like to do more of this too!

Outside of my day job I play plenty of games, hang out with friends, attend many [Les Mills](http://www.lesmills.com) classes
and fight crime in a very snazzy cape. Okay, that last one was a lie. I don't have a cape.

# This site looks familiar
Yeah it's an awesome theme called [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) from [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo).
Perhaps in the future I'll write my own, but for now I really like this one.

# What games do you play?!
You, you asked. Alright. Well...

* Counter Strike: Global Offensive
* Battlefield 4
* Minecraft
    * Check out The Mindcrack Crack Pack. Great fun, great fun.
* Watch Dogs
* League of Legends
* Something else that's probably a flash in a pan. Who knows.

# Cool, can I come stalk you some place?
Well, if you insist. My twitter is [@JakeHendy](https://twitter.com/JakeHendy),
my Steam name is Fluxi[E] (don't ask), my Origin name is MrJakeHendy, my GitHub
account is [JakeHendy](https://www.github.com/JakeHendy) too. Although I don't
push much out to GitHub at the moment.
